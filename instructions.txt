TOOL 13: KANO MODEL ANALYSIS TOOL
================================================================================

APPLICATION OVERVIEW:
This is a free online interactive Kano Model graph and summary table to analyze customer satisfaction.
The tool helps visually categorize product features into five Kano categories (Attractive, Performance, Must-Be, Indifferent, Reverse, Questionable) based on customer survey responses.
It calculates the Customer Satisfaction Index (CS) and provides a visualization of the Kano graph.

KEY COMPONENTS:

1. DATA INPUT SYSTEM:
- Three wizard tabs: Theory & Info, Input & Edit Features, Results
- Input form for features: description, functional response (If present, customer feels: Like it, Expect it, Neutral, Can live with it, Dislike it), dysfunctional response (If not present, customer feels: same options)
- Dynamic categorization table in Input tab showing features by Kano category with remove buttons
- Example data loading (10 example features) and reset functionality

2. CALCULATION ENGINE:
- Kano categorization based on the Kano evaluation table (using functional and dysfunctional responses)
- Customer Satisfaction Index (CS) calculation:
  • CS+ (Satisfaction Index) = (A + O) / (A + O + M + I)
  • CS- (Dissatisfaction Index) = (O + M) / (A + O + M + I) × (-1)
- Feature categorization into: Attractive, Performance, Must-Be, Indifferent, Reverse, Questionable

3. VISUALIZATION SYSTEM:
- Interactive Kano graph (scatter plot) with theoretical curves for each category
- Chart built with Chart.js, displaying features as points on the Kano graph (Satisfaction vs Fulfillment axes)
- Summary table of features by category (editable in Input tab, read-only in Results tab)
- CS Index display with two cards (CS+ and CS-)

4. UI STRUCTURE:
- Wizard-style tabs: Theory & Info, Input & Edit Features, Results
- Main action buttons (Load Example, Reset All) above tabs
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Tab navigation buttons between tabs

5. URL PARAMETER SUPPORT:
- tab: Active main tab (tab-theory, tab-input-edit, tab-results)
- auto_calculate: Trigger automatic calculation and switch to Results tab (1 or true)
- feature_input: Feature description text
- functional_select: Functional response value (0-4, corresponding to the five options: 0=Like it, 1=Expect it (Must-be), 2=Neutral, 3=Can live with it, 4=Dislike it)
- dysfunctional_select: Dysfunctional response value (0-4, same mapping as functional)
- Note: The universal Query Handler will map parameters to field IDs by converting to lowercase and replacing underscores with hyphens. For example, 'feature_input' maps to field with id 'featureInput'.

HOW TO INTERACT WITH THE JAVASCRIPT:

A. INITIALIZATION:
- The application loads with empty analyzedFeatures array
- Event listeners are set up for form submission, buttons, etc.
- Chart.js and SheetJS are loaded from CDN
- Global kanoApp object is initialized with methods and state

B. CORE FUNCTIONS:

1. switchWizardTab(tabId)
   - Switches between main wizard tabs
   - Updates active tab styling and content visibility
   - Resizes and updates chart if switching to Results tab

2. addFeatureToList(description, funcAnswer, dysfuncAnswer)
   - Adds a new feature to the analyzedFeatures array
   - Categorizes the feature using the Kano table
   - Updates the UI (chart, tables, CS index)

3. removeFeature(featureName)
   - Removes a specific feature from the analyzedFeatures array
   - Updates the UI

4. removeCategory(categoryName)
   - Removes all features in a specific category
   - Updates the UI

5. resetAnalysis()
   - Clears the analyzedFeatures array after confirmation
   - Updates the UI

6. loadExample()
   - Loads 10 example features with functional and dysfunctional responses
   - Steps through each example with a delay for visual effect
   - Updates the UI and switches to Input & Edit tab

7. calculateCSIndex(featuresByCategory)
   - Calculates CS+ and CS- indices based on category counts
   - Returns formatted values and counts

8. drawChart(featuresByCategory)
   - Creates or updates the Kano chart with theoretical curves and feature points
   - Uses Chart.js with custom logo plugin

9. updateUI()
   - Updates the categorization tables, chart, and CS index display

10. exportAnalysis()
    - Exports the complete analysis to Excel using SheetJS
    - Includes feature list, categorization, CS index, and analysis information

C. DATA FLOW:
1. User adds a feature via the form -> addFeatureToList is called
2. Feature is categorized and added to analyzedFeatures array
3. UI updates: chart, tables, and CS index are refreshed
4. User can remove individual features or entire categories
5. User can load example data or reset all
6. User can export the analysis to Excel

D. UI UPDATES:
- Chart updates with new points and theoretical curves
- Categorization tables update in both Input and Results tabs
- CS index cards update with new values
- Notifications show on actions (add, remove, reset, etc.)
- Tabs switch with smooth animations

E. URL PARAMETER INTEGRATION:
- The universal Query Handler will inject parameters into the form fields.
- After injection, if auto_calculate is set, the tool will automatically calculate and switch to the Results tab.
- Field mapping is based on converting parameter names to lowercase and replacing underscores with hyphens to match field IDs.

Example URL:
https://sigmaexacta.com/kano.html?feature_input=Fast%20Check-in&functional_select=0&dysfunctional_select=4&tab=tab-input-edit&auto_calculate=1

This URL would:
1. Set the feature description to "Fast Check-in"
2. Set functional response to "Like it" (value 0)
3. Set dysfunctional response to "Dislike it" (value 4)
4. Open the Input & Edit Features tab
5. Automatically calculate and display results in the Results tab

F. UI FEEDBACK:
- Notification system for actions (feature added, removed, example loaded, etc.)
- Smooth animations for tab switching and chart updates
- Hover effects on chart points to show feature names

G. ERROR HANDLING:
- Input validation for feature description (non-empty)
- Confirmation dialog for reset action
- Graceful handling of empty analysis in exports

H. EXTENSION POINTS:
- Additional import functionality (from Excel or JSON)
- More example datasets
- Advanced filtering and sorting of features
- Sharing analysis via URL with multiple features (currently only one feature can be loaded via URL)
